Hello ResBazzers, ResBazQld 2023 is getting near now and we're starting to get excited about it – we hope you are too! So that you can get the most out of your three days, 
here's a few suggestions from us to help you prepare. And while you’re doing that, make sure you encourage your friends and colleagues to register as well – there are 
still tickets available and at ResBaz it's "the more the merrier”, so please spread the word.

On Wednesday evening, we'll be holding a social event at UQ’s Belltop Café, featuring the return of ResBaz favourite: "Ninety Seconds of Research Impact". All you have 
to do is tell us about your research in 90 seconds or less - no props, no slides, just you and a microphone! So start planning and practicing your talk now - there are 
prizes! Talking of prizes, we've got daily competitions and lucky door tickets, so you have even more chances to win stuff!

Very important - if you haven't done so already, don't forget to plan your schedule and sign up for any workshops you want to attend before they book out; your registration 
includes the workshops, but you *must* book a place to be able to attend. Take a [look at the program](https://resbaz.github.io/resbaz2023qld/schedule/), decide what sessions 
you like, and register using the links on our [booking page](https://resbaz.github.io/resbaz2023qld/blog/workshop-booking-open). Remember, don’t double book yourself if you 
sign-up for one of the multi-session workshops (Programming with Python, R for scientific analysis, or Introduction to image analysis with FIJI)!

Finally, ResBaz wouldn’t be possible without the generous support of our sponsors – [ARDC](https://ardc.edu.au/), 
[Gale](https://www.gale.com/intl/primary-sources/digital-scholar-lab), and [Sage](https://learningresources.sagepub.com/home). Please take a moment to visit their websites, 
and have a chat with them at their exhibitor booths during the week, to thank them for being an important part of ResBaz.

We look forward to seeing you all soon.
