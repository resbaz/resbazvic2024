Hello ResBazzers, just one week to go now to ResBazQld 2023!!! With it getting very near now, we'll be sending you several information emails over the next few days - 
sorry about any repeated information, but we want to make sure that you have all the details needed to make the most of this event. And for even more hints and tips 
about how to get the most out of ResBazQld, make sure to follow us at @ResBazQld on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/resbazqld) and 
[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/resbazqld/), where our mascot "Bazza the ResBaz bear" will be giving you daily updates. 

Most importantly at this stage, make sure you've signed up for any workshops that you want to attend - many are getting very full already. Take a look at 
[the program](https://resbaz.github.io/resbaz2023qld/schedule/), decide what sessions you like, and 
[book yourself a place](https://resbaz.github.io/resbaz2023qld/blog/workshop-booking-open). Remember, don’t double book yourself if you sign-up for one of 
the multi-session workshops (Programming with Python, R for scientific analysis, or Introduction to image analysis with FIJI)!

Almost as importantly, there are plenty of PRIZES to be won at ResBaz, so make sure you get involved to give yourself the best chance to win! Some of our competitions 
include:

* A lucky door prize for each of our key story speaker sessions. Not to mention that they’ll all be amazing talks anyway!
* The "Ninety Seconds of Research Impact" competition during our social reception on Wednesday evening. All you have to do is tell us about your research in 90 seconds or less - no props, no slides, just you and a microphone! 
* Our networking games and competitions - ResBaz Bingo, the Name Badge Challenge, the Acronym Game, and the Data Science Riddle. More on those next week!

Finally, one of our key story speakers – Professor Michael Milford from QUT – has given us a sneak preview of his talk in 
[this post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/michaeljmilford_artificialintelligence-careeradvice-careers-activity-7127852675492171776-67_4); check it out!

See you all next week, and remember there is still [time to register](https://events.humanitix.com/resbazqld-2023), so let your friends know if they haven’t already signed up!

Kind regards, from the ResBaz Qld team (resbaz@qcif.edu.au)
