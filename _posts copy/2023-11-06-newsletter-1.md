ResBazQld 2023 is now only a couple of weeks away now, so it's time to start planning your ResBaz activities! 

We have heaps going on every day, but most of our workshops do have limited capacity so you will need to book to ensure your place. Have a look at our 
[schedule](https://resbaz.github.io/resbaz2023qld/schedule/), decide what sessions you want to attend, and go to 
[the booking information page](https://resbaz.github.io/resbaz2023qld/blog/workshop-booking-open) to find registration links. 

Some of the workshops run over multiple sessions, so please make sure you don't double-book yourself! And we expect many of them to be very popular, so 
get in early before spaces fill up.

There are still tickets available for ResBaz, and because we're all about community and connections, the more people who can join us the better. So please 
tell all your friends and colleagues, and encourage them to come along too. They're not going to find better value than a three day conference for $40 with 
food, drink, evening social event, and prizes included!

We look forward to seeing you all soon.
