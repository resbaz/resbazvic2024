Hi ResBazzers, the countdown to ResBazQld 2023 is well and truly underway now, and we’re getting ready to welcome you to UQ’s St Lucia campus on Tuesday.

First, our regular reminder to please [book your workshop places](https://resbaz.github.io/resbaz2023qld/blog/workshop-booking-open) (and thank you to those of you who have already done so). Many of the workshops **will** book out, and entry to those will be limited to those who have signed up in advance. So if you don’t want to miss out, get your bookings in now!!!! [Check out the schedule](https://resbaz.github.io/resbaz2023qld/schedule/) and [follow these instructions](https://resbaz.github.io/resbaz2023qld/blog/workshop-booking-open) to guarantee your spot. And remember that a few workshops run over multiple sessions, so don’t double-book yourself.

As well as the scheduled program of workshops and talks, there are plenty of other activities going on over ResBazQld. Two highlights of these will be our social evening on Wednesday and “Hacky Corner” every breaktime. 

The social evening will be held at Belltop Café 5.30 – 7.30pm on Wednesday, and we hope many of you will join us there for nibbles and drinks, and of course watching or taking part in the legendary "90 Seconds of Research Impact" challenge. Did we mention there will be **prizes**?

Hacky Corner is an extension of the popular “Hacky Hour” that takes place at nearly all Queensland universities. It’s a casual drop-in help community running each break time, where our volunteer team will try to answer any and all of your research computing related questions. Look out for the signs in the exhibitors/catering area and ask away! And if you’re a programmer/HPC user/data manager or any other support specialist or experienced user who likes helping others, come along too and share your expertise.

Don’t forget, [registration will stay open](https://events.humanitix.com/resbazqld-2023) for the rest of the week, so if your friends haven’t registered yet, let them know they can still join in the fun!

See you soon! 

Kind regards, from the ResBazQld team (resbaz@qcif.edu.au)
