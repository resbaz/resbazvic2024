  description: <p>The goal of this course is to provide introductory training in spatial data processing, visualization, and mapping using R. The course focuses on a small set of popular packages for these tasks, many of which are drawn from a collection of packages called tidyverse. We will explain the new capabilities of packages terra and sf, why they should be used instead of other alternatives such as raster and sp,  and how packages with strong dependencies on rgdal, rgeos and maptools (recently archived on CRAN) must be either upgraded to use sf, terra or other alternatives.  We'll also create some graphs to summarize the data and explore options for map generation.</p>

  themes: [0]

  speakers: [1]
  subtype: Talk
  service:
  hidden: false
  description: <p>Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences (HASS) research data plays a crucial role in advancing our comprehension of culture, society, and human well-being. In 2020, the HASS and Indigenous Research Data Commons (HASS and I RDC) Program was established with the objective of establishing a comprehensive digital research infrastructure for HASS and Indigenous researchers and communities. Key strands of the HASS&I RDC that have been developed to date include:</p><ul><li>Language Data Commons of Australia,</li><li>Integrated Research Infrastructure for Social Sciences,</li><li>Improving Indigenous Research Capabilities,</li><li>Community Data Lab.</li></ul><p>This interconnected network of people, data resources, and research tools is bound together by shared technical standards, distributed technical systems, deliberate governance frameworks, open-source tools, and extensive training provisions. It is essential to emphasize that the program is firmly committed to Indigenous data governance and sovereignty, which underpin its fundamental principles. This presentation will anthropomorphise the condition of digital HASS data to highlight the individuals, families and cultural groups represented within ‘people’ data. The audience will gain insights into the challenges associated with reclaiming cultural heritage, achieved through rigorous exploration of Aboriginal languages, stories, art, and identity. Additionally, we will explore the recontextualization of historic research within a contemporary framework.</p>

  title: Hopefully good and some definitively bad advice for researchers in the digital AI age

  description: <p>Researchers are expected to know their field inside out and be on top of the application domains the research they are doing can benefit. This requirement can be a challenging endeavour at the best of times, but has become extraordinarily chaotic in light of the pace of recent developments in the digital domain, particularly in areas like artificial intelligence, and their increasingly wide reaching consequences. How is our way of doing research being disrupted, both positively and negatively? Are the things we’re researching even relevant anymore, given the rapid change in the application domains where that research might be used? Questions like these can make even the most self-assured researcher doubt their path forwards. A sensible action to take in such circumstances is to ask experienced peers for advice, but what was “sensible” and valid advice even five years ago isn’t necessarily good advice today. In my talk, I’ll present insights and advice, both good and bad, for how to successfully navigate current changes, drawing upon my experiences advising industry, government and research sectors.</p>

  description: <p>Video-based learning is built upon Mayer’s multimedia theory of learning, which emphasises the value of flexible communication skills to lower the burden of cognitive load for diverse audiences.  Online multimedia can be leveraged for science communication, but the production of high-quality online resources has significant resource implications.  This project evaluated large undergraduate science courses that embedded over 100 hours of video content from 2020-2022 to determine best-practice guidelines for producing effective online multimedia.  Participant survey and interview results revealed broad agreement with the value of segmenting information, presenter presence, and mixed perspectives in science videos.  However individual student preferences varied on the extent of presenters’ on-screen visibility, use of graphics, and subtitling.  Video analytics revealed a decrease in viewer retention as each video progresses, but this rate of decline can be slowed through on-screen text, animations, and camera angle changes. Together this data provides an evidence-based framework for designing science videos that will engage different online audiences and disseminate your research.</p>

Join Rachel in this session to discover the many reasons why research commercialisation matters, and explore the pathways to commercialise research. This is basically a crash course in research commercialisation mixed with a dash of personal reflections from Rachel’s entrepreneurship and research commercialisation experience so far. The goal of this session is for you to walk away feeling inspired and encouraged and hopefully thinking about how your research can be commercialised.</p>

  description: '<p>The Australian Reference Genome Atlas (ARGA) is a recently launched online platform for genomic data discovery across non-human, eukaryotic organisms. It indexes and aggregates data from a range of repositories, including NCBI GenBank, Barcode of Life Data system (BOLD) and Bioplatforms Australia''s data portal, enabling users to search across multiple sources from a centralised portal. Where possible, genomic data are intersected with specimen information available from formalised collections (e.g. museums, herbaria) to supplement relevant metadata.</p><p>This workshop will feature a demo of the ARGA platform, giving an overview of its uses and allowing time for questions and discussions. The workshop will cover how ARGA can help to: </p><ul><li>visualise and explore geographic occurrences of specimens (both with and without derived sequence data)</li><li>investigate the metadata available for each step in the chain of events between specimen collection and data deposition to help assess and compare sequences</li><li>discover genomic data for species according to thematic, ecological or trait groupings, such as threatened species, crop wild relatives, or poisonous and venomous species</li><li>determine summary statistics for genomic data availability across taxonomic clades or in thematic groupings (e.g. proportion of frog species with genome assemblies available, proportion of threatened Australian species with any available genomic data)</li></ul>'

This workshop will go through some of these less obvious things that you need to consider and watch put for when moving your calculations from a desktop to a HPC. There is no need to have HPC access as this workshop will use demonstrations that participants can just watch and follow. This is aimed at those with no HPC experience and even those who are only starting out on their journey on doing calculations on their desktops.</p>

Using Gale&rsquo;s Primary Source materials from the 18th Century together with the Gale Digital Scholar Lab, researchers and academics are constantly discovering new details about this Enlightened era.</p><p>The Gale Digital Scholar Lab offers a straightforward entry point into Digital Humanities for new researchers and for more experienced scholars, the Lab provides access to large data sets that can be easily mined and exported for use in custom applications and open-source analytical tools. With the Lab, Gale has created a research platform to help bridge the gap that often exists between primary sources that are available in the library and the research needs and workflows of faculty and students.</p><p>Digital humanists will be less inclined to bypass the library and seek content from open web sources or create their own data sets through unreliable and painstaking processes. As an extension of your primary source collections, Gale Digital Scholar Lab will encourage the use of archival holdings to support broader research needs.</p>
