  description: <p>We discuss the new post-Twitter social media landscape and ramifications for research. Then we introduce NewsTalk, a data bank of public reader comments, and how this platform can answer many of the same research questions in Australia. In this workshop we discuss the ethics procedures to gain access to NewsTalk, and we show how to use the tool including finding news stories and download data bundles of reader comments. We also describe the output data format and examine some of the participant's suggestions of public topics in the NewsTalk data.</p>
