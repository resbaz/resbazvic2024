Helping HASS students answer the question: Do you need the digital in your research?	Internet Content and AI	3	1	13	12	Workshop	FALSE	FALSE	In the first semester of 2023, the Australian Text Analytics Program (with support from The University of Queensland Graduate School) ran a Graduate Digital Research Fellowship program. The program was open to post-graduate students based in SE Qld; of the four participants, three were from UQ and one was from Griffith. The application process encouraged potential fellows to think of projects which were related to but not directly part of their main research project and which would require them to develop skills in digital research methods. One of the participants also carried out a placement with AARNet under a UQ program for HDR students.  This session will be a panel discussion including the two leaders of the program, our AARNet colleague, and the four fellows, discussing issues including (but not limited to): How do digital research methods fit in a variety of HASS disciplines? How receptive are established scholars in those disciplines to new methods? What did we all learn from this experience? Was the additional burden worth it for our fellows - were their research lives enriched or just made more complicated?

Tips for moving from Desktop to HPC	Research Computing	6	2	26	31	Workshop	FALSE	FALSE	Transitioning from running your calculations on a desktop to running them on HPC needs consideration of using the command line, queues and sharing resources. These are the obvious changes. However, there are many small changes like considering where your input and output are coming from and need to be stored, how to get to your output if you are used to seeing it on your screen. This workshop will go through some of these less obvious things that you need to consider and watch put for when moving your calculations from a desktop to a HPC. There is no need to have HPC access as this workshop will use demonstrations that participants can just watch and follow. This is aimed at those with no HPC experience and even those who are only starting out on their journey on doing calculations on their desktops.

Introduction to processing, visualization and mapping of spatial data in R	#REF!			0	45	Workshop	FALSE	FALSE	The goal of this course is to provide introductory training in spatial data processing, visualization, and mapping using R. The course focuses on a small set of popular packages for these tasks, many of which are drawn from a collection of packages called tidyverse. We will explain the new capabilities of packages terra and sf, why they should be used instead of other alternatives such as raster and sp,  and how packages with strong dependencies on rgdal, rgeos and maptools (recently archived on CRAN) must be either upgraded to use sf, terra or other alternatives.  We'll also create some graphs to summarize the data and explore options for map generation.				17	Betsy Alpert (she/they)										
Exploring genomic data with the Australian Reference Genome Atlas	Data Literacy, Openness and Frontiers	4	9	94	46, 47	Workshop	FALSE	FALSE	The Australian Reference Genome Atlas (ARGA) is a recently launched online platform for genomic data discovery across non-human, eukaryotic organisms. It indexes and aggregates data from a range of repositories, including NCBI GenBank, Barcode of Life Data system (BOLD) and Bioplatforms Australia's data portal, enabling users to search across multiple sources from a centralised portal. Where possible, genomic data are intersected with specimen information available from formalised collections (e.g. museums, herbaria) to supplement relevant metadata.  This workshop will feature a demo of the ARGA platform, giving an overview of its uses and allowing time for questions and discussions. The workshop will cover how ARGA can help to:   - visualise and explore geographic occurrences of specimens (both with and without derived sequence data)  - investigate the metadata available for each step in the chain of events between specimen collection and data deposition to help assess and compare sequences  - discover genomic data for species according to thematic, ecological or trait groupings, such as threatened species, crop wild relatives, or poisonous and venomous species  - determine summary statistics for genomic data availability across taxonomic clades or in thematic groupings (e.g. proportion of frog species with genome assemblies available, proportion of threatened Australian species with any available genomic data)				18	Eliza Howard (she/her)										
Guided networking session 	Soft Skills	5	5	55	2	Workshop	FALSE	FALSE	Networking is an important aspect for the career development of PhDs - both to create collaborations and find future job opportunities. However, it is a softskill not thought in university courses. I facilitate guided networking sessions for organisations and think it will benefit PhDs greatly too. The participants will practise "openness, kindness and honesty" through a series of guided discussions around the following topics:  - using meaningful questions to guide small groups of participants to get to know each other  - facilitate groups to share their challenges and help each other with their challenges - Determine their own values  - Use their values to revisit their challenges  - Reflecting on networking experience and their learnings				19	Sonia Ramza
