### ResBaz workshop bookings are open

Once you have registered for ResBaz, you need to book into the workshops of your choice. 
All workshop bookings are **free of charge**, but most have limited capacity so we can 
only let you into that workshop if you have booked a place.

Decide on your [schedule](https://resbaz.github.io/resbaz2023qld/schedule/), then click
the links below to go to the relevant booking pages. You will need to have your **ResBaz
order number** handy when booking - this is just below the QR code in your ResBaz
registration confirmation email.

**VERY IMPORTANT**  
Three of the workshops (Programming with Python, R for Scientific Analysis, 
and Introduction to Image Analysis with FIJI) run over multiple sessions, and you are 
expected to attend all sessions if you register for these subjects. You only need to 
register for the first session, but that booking will apply to all sessions. **DO NOT** 
book for other workshops at the same times.
