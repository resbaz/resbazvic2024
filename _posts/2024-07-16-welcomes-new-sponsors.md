ResBaz Victoria is thrilled to announce and welcome its newly confirmed sponsors, the Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC), GALE, and AARNet. Thank you for your support and interest in engaging with Monash and the Australian ResBaz community.

The Organising Committee will soon be calling for Expressions of Interest for those who want to get involved, whether by running a workshop, giving a talk, or volunteering to chair a session. If you already have ideas on how to participate, please reach out to us at ResBazVIC-l@monash.edu.

We are currently finalising details, so please watch out for upcoming updates.
