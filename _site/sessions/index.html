As an HDR student or ECR -- are you aware of research infrastructure at your institution? What services, resources, and facilities can you access as an HDR? Even more importantly, could you turn research infrastructure into a career?</p><p>This two-part workshop will help you answer these questions, and provide information about the secret third career option: not research, not professional, but an excellent option for HDRs across many fields. Firstly, participants will discover (for themselves!) information about their own institutions: what services/training exist, where it’s advertised, how the institution handles RI, and who manages it. Then we will present success stories of people moving from research fields into RI, and help the participants consider if an RI career is right for them.</p></span> <div class="slot-theme"> <div style="background-color:#1e90ff12; color: #000000; border-color: #1e90ff;"> Research Computing </div> <div style="background-color:#ffd70012; color: #000000; border-color: #ffd700;"> Personal and Career Development </div> </div> </div> <div class="grid-item theme_0 "> <h5>Digital data for HASS and Indigenous researchers: ‘people’ behind the data</h5> <p> <span class="theme-metadata">Talk</span> </p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <hr /> <span class="text-body"><p>Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences (HASS) research data plays a crucial role in advancing our comprehension of culture, society, and human well-being. In 2020, the HASS and Indigenous Research Data Commons (HASS and I RDC) Program was established with the objective of establishing a comprehensive digital research infrastructure for HASS and Indigenous researchers and communities. Key strands of the HASS&I RDC that have been developed to date include:</p><ul><li>Language Data Commons of Australia,</li><li>Integrated Research Infrastructure for Social Sciences,</li><li>Improving Indigenous Research Capabilities,</li><li>Community Data Lab.</li></ul><p>This interconnected network of people, data resources, and research tools is bound together by shared technical standards, distributed technical systems, deliberate governance frameworks, open-source tools, and extensive training provisions. It is essential to emphasize that the program is firmly committed to Indigenous data governance and sovereignty, which underpin its fundamental principles. This presentation will anthropomorphise the condition of digital HASS data to highlight the individuals, families and cultural groups represented within ‘people’ data. The audience will gain insights into the challenges associated with reclaiming cultural heritage, achieved through rigorous exploration of Aboriginal languages, stories, art, and identity. Additionally, we will explore the recontextualization of historic research within a contemporary framework.</p></span> <div class="slot-theme"> <div style="background-color:#ff000012; color: #000000; border-color: #ff0000;"> Keystory Talk </div> </div> </div> <div class="grid-item theme_0 "> <h5>Digital research infrastructure - Building 'datascopes' for 21st century discovery and the role of research infrastructure in the future</h5> <p> <span class="theme-metadata">Talk</span> </p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <hr /> <span class="text-body"><p>Digital research infrastructure has become paramount for the advancement of all scientific research and innovation.

This requirement can be a challenging endeavour at the best of times, but has become extraordinarily chaotic in light of the pace of recent developments in the digital domain, particularly in areas like artificial intelligence, and their increasingly wide reaching consequences. How is our way of doing research being disrupted, both positively and negatively? Are the things we’re researching even relevant anymore, given the rapid change in the application domains where that research might be used? Questions like these can make even the most self-assured researcher doubt their path forwards. A sensible action to take in such circumstances is to ask experienced peers for advice, but what was “sensible” and valid advice even five years ago isn’t necessarily good advice today. In my talk, I’ll present insights and advice, both good and bad, for how to successfully navigate current changes, drawing upon my experiences advising industry, government and research sectors.</p></span> <div class="slot-theme"> <div style="background-color:#ff000012; color: #000000; border-color: #ff0000;"> Keystory Talk </div> </div> </div> <div class="grid-item theme_0 "> <h5>Online science communication: an evidence-based guide on how to get started</h5> <p> <span class="theme-metadata">Talk</span> </p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <hr /> <span class="text-body"><p>Video-based learning is built upon Mayer’s multimedia theory of learning, which emphasises the value of flexible communication skills to lower the burden of cognitive load for diverse audiences. Online multimedia can be leveraged for science communication, but the production of high-quality online resources has significant resource implications. This project evaluated large undergraduate science courses that embedded over 100 hours of video content from 2020-2022 to determine best-practice guidelines for producing effective online multimedia. Participant survey and interview results revealed broad agreement with the value of segmenting information, presenter presence, and mixed perspectives in science videos. However individual student preferences varied on the extent of presenters’ on-screen visibility, use of graphics, and subtitling. Video analytics revealed a decrease in viewer retention as each video progresses, but this rate of decline can be slowed through on-screen text, animations, and camera angle changes. Together this data provides an evidence-based framework for designing science videos that will engage different online audiences and disseminate your research.</p></span> <div class="slot-theme"> <div style="background-color:#ff000012; color: #000000; border-color: #ff0000;"> Keystory Talk </div> </div> </div> <div class="grid-item theme_0 "> <h5>From Research Platforms to Commercial Platforms</h5> <p> <span class="theme-metadata">Talk</span> </p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <hr /> <span class="text-body">What lessons can be learnt when transitioning from a research based environment to a commercial environment and how we at Ceres Tag were able to transform a research product into an international commercial product.</span> <div class="slot-theme"> <div style="background-color:#ff000012; color: #000000; border-color: #ff0000;"> Keystory Talk </div> </div> </div> <div class="grid-item theme_0 "> <h5>Unlocking innovation: The science of research commercialisation</h5> <p> <span class="theme-metadata">Talk</span> </p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <hr /> <span class="text-body"><p>There are many reasons a researcher should think about the commercialisation of their research, from tangibly solving the world's biggest problems, to creating more industry engagement and increasing funding opportunities in the future.

As an extension of your primary source collections, Gale Digital Scholar Lab will encourage the use of archival holdings to support broader research needs.</p></span> <div class="slot-theme"> <div style="background-color:#1e90ff12; color: #000000; border-color: #1e90ff;"> Research Computing </div> </div> </div> <div class="grid-item theme_6 "> <h5>Your research toolkit in the cloud</h5> <p> <span class="theme-metadata">Workshop</span> </p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <hr /> <span class="text-body"><p>Learn more about how you use the ARDC Nectar Cloud to improve your research!
